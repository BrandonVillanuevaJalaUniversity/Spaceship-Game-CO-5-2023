# The Neo-Spaceship

This program consists of an attempt to recreate the retro metal slug video game based on the final mission scenario 2.
Taking the game as a reference, the program tries to use sprites and soundtracks to simulate said mission.

The basic controls for player one are the arrow keys for the roof and the spreader bar and for player two are the typical keys (a,s,d,w) using the f key to shoot.

The goal is to get the highest score by shooting enemies and bosses.

you can use the 'p' key for a fast advance and to select the players you press the numerical keys '1 and 2'
